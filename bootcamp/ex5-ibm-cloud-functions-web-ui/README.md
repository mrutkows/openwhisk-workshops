### Background

IBM Cloud Functions comes with a Web UI to help developers manage their serverless applications. Common development tasks such as creating actions, monitoring invocations, setting up triggers and more can all be achieved using this web application. The web application is custom to IBM Cloud and not part of the open-source Apache OpenWhisk project.

It can often be quicker to use the Web UI for certain development tasks, rather than typing repetitive CLI commands. The web UI integrates with the IBM Cloud interface, making it easy to provision and connect new cloud services to your applications.

In this exercise, we'll show you the different features of the IBM Cloud Web UI….
